You can improve your health and make money through entrepreneurship and investing. To start your own local chapter please contact us.\n\nEMMA Foundation is a US-based, non-profit, IRS 501(c)(3) global philanthropic organization. Its entire accounting system is open to its members, 100% transparent. Its goal is to enable individuals to reach their maximum potential through the founder’s modeled 8 Pistons – Game of Life.\n\nEMMA Foundation provides 7 tiers of daily and/or weekly, non-denominational preaching and education to the general public in pursuit of health, wealth, enlightenment, eudaemonic, ascetic, stoic, balanced-epicurean lifestyle, with proper diet, exercise, self-mastery, yoga, and meditation to benefit oneself and people around us."

        "text": "Most charity organizations feed the body by providing food to the hungry and shelter to the homeless, which are all good for urgent and temporary relief. EMMA wants to feed the human soul, spirit, subconscious and conscious mind.\n\nEMMA believes that the root causes of the problem are the bad ideas, beliefs, and value systems ingrained in one’s own mind that one never questioned, examined, nor recalibrated. That is why EMMA spends a smaller percentage of its funds for material and physical help and a larger percentage to feed the mind and the soul.\n\nEMMA’s founder doesn’t believe in Free Will, therefore he is against the death penalty but is for jail terms for deterrent, rehabilitation, and restitution purposes – never for punishment, revenge, or retribution. Everyone should be given initial equal opportunity and respect, but everyone is not created equal, and among those who are created equal do not attain equal socio-economic status, intellect, or wisdom.\n\nPath to “The 1%” (of US)\nMunzer’s 8 Pistons – Game of Life.\n\nWatch your actions, not just words. Excluding sleeping, eating, hygiene, survival hours, the percentage of the remaining 12–14 hours/day – your discretionary time – that you spend on each piston will tell you about your self-deception. Expose your lies and go through purgatory now for an enlightened life."

        "text": "Munzer's 8 Pistons – Rev # 98, …\n\nTo reach one’s maximum potential to tackle worldly problems, material and spiritual, one must first enlighten one’s own mind by replacing bad ideas with good ones – well-thought-out logical ideas based on 21st century science (21CS), reason, and truth, and sometimes with a slight touch of myth when necessary.\n\nEMMA wants to feed the Soul – the mind through which one figures out good from bad, right from wrong, and truth from lies. EMMA’s founder practices the 8 Pistons and has achieved great results. EMMA is propagating this value system and process to make the world a little better place.\n\nWe favor objective meritocracy (with some charity) over blind equity. Any and all ideas in this poster can be modified as society changes or as human, AI, ASI, AGI hybrids emerge.\n\nLocal, state, federal governments, technofeudalism, UNO, IMF, WTO, WEF, corporations, Hollywood, educational systems, social media, virtue signaling, woke-ism, cancel culture, snowflake mentality, safe-space, trigger warnings, euphemism, SJW, DEI, equal outcome (equity), your job, even places of worship won’t help you become independent, smart, healthy, wealthy, self-reliant, and self-sufficient. Therefore, you have to do it yourself.\n\nThink independently. Avoid “collective illusion”, inadequate equilibria, and “unhealthy social norms”. EMMA’s goal is to help you get there – to high 8PQ."
